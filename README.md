Parkinson's Disease Analysis Project

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for an analysis project focused on differentiating individuals with Parkinson's Disease (PPD) from healthy individuals using voice data. The goal of the analysis is to identify sailent variables(features) that can help distinguish between PPD patients and non patients.

## Project Goals

1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing:**

2. **Identifying Salient Features:**

3. **Descriptive and Inferential Analyses:**

4. **Data Visualization:**

5. **Machine Learning Consideration (Optional):**

6. **Documentation and Reporting:**

## Repository Structure
- `data`: Contains the dataset((`po1_data.txt`).
- `notebook`: .py notebook detailing each step of the analysis.
- `visualizations`: Plots and charts generated for data visualization.
- `reports`: Report summarizing the steps, difficuties, analysis, findings, and conclusions.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries specified in the requirment.txt file.
3. Follow the instructions in the .py notebooks to perform the analysis.
4. Explore the visualizations and results generated during the analysis.
5. Review the final report in the `reports` folder for a overview.
